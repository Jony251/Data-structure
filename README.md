## Introduction

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added and removed only from the top of the stack. This structure is fundamental in various applications, including expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and function call management.

## Exercises

The repository includes the following Java exercises:

1. **Check if Two Stacks are Equal** (`checksIfTheStringInStacksAreEqual.java`): Compares two stacks to determine if they contain identical sequences of elements.

2. **Verify Stack in Descending Order** (`ifStackIsInDescendingOrder.java`): Checks whether the elements in a stack are arranged in descending order.

3. **Input Until Sentinel Value** (`inputUntilUserWillInputMinus999.java`): Continuously accepts user input and pushes it onto a stack until the sentinel value `-999` is entered.

4. **Insert Integer into Sorted Stack** (`insertAnIntegerInSortedStack.java`): Inserts a given integer into its correct position within a pre-sorted stack.

5. **Move First Stack Element to End** (`moveTheFirstStackElementToEnd.java`): Transfers the top element of the stack to its bottom.

6. **Move Last Stack Element to Top** (`moveTheLastElementInTheStackToTopOfStack.java`): Moves the bottom element of the stack to the top.

7. **Reverse a Stack** (`reversingStack.java`): Reverses the order of elements in a stack.

8. **Find Largest Double in Stack** (`searchForTheLargestDoubleInStack.java`): Searches for and returns the largest `double` value present in the stack.

9. **Sort Stack of Doubles** (`sortStackOfDoubles.java`): Sorts a stack containing `double` values in ascending order.

## Getting Started

To run these exercises, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) version 11 or higher
- A Java IDE or text editor of your choice

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jony251/Data-structure_Stacks.git
   cd Data-structure_Stacks
   
2. **Compile and Run**:
   
   Compile and Run a Java file:

   * Navigate to the specific Java file you want to run.
   * To compile the file, type: javac FileName.java
   * To execute the program, type: java FileName
     (Replace "FileName" with the actual Java file name.)
