## Introduction

Stacks are fundamental data structures that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They are essential in various algorithms and applications, such as expression evaluation, backtracking, and memory management. This repository provides practical implementations of stack operations to enhance understanding and proficiency in using stacks.

## Exercises

The repository includes the following Java exercises:

1. **checksIfTheStringInStacksAreEqual.java**: Compares two stacks to determine if the strings they represent are equal.
2. **ifStackIsInDescendingOrder.java**: Checks if the elements in a stack are in descending order.
3. **inputUntilUserWillInputMinus999.java**: Continuously accepts user input and pushes it onto the stack until the user inputs `-999`.
4. **insertAnIntegerInSortedStack.java**: Inserts an integer into a stack while maintaining its sorted order.
5. **moveTheFirstStackElementToEnd.java**: Moves the first element of the stack to its end.
6. **moveTheLastElementInTheStackToTopOfStack.java**: Moves the last element of the stack to the top.
7. **reversingStack.java**: Reverses the order of elements in the stack.
8. **searchForTheLargestDoubleInStack.java**: Finds the largest double value in a stack.
9. **sortStackOfDoubles.java**: Sorts a stack containing double values.
